HamControl: ESP8266 Based Amateur Radio Simplex Confirmation Project 

http://www.whiskeytangohotel.com/2018/03/hamcontrol-esp8266-based-amateur-radio.html

Most Amateur (or ham) radio operators have wondered how or if their signal is getting received.  
After getting a YES/NO answer they may want to decrease power, try a different antenna set up, or change location.  
The challenge with this can be a willing participant on the receive side that has promised to remain perfectly 
still and listen for hours.  If you have a friend or XYL willing to do that then consider yourself fortunate.  
For all the others there is this project.
